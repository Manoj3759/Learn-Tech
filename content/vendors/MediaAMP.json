The service enables faculty and staff to upload, manage, and deliver audio and video content in support of University initiatives, including teaching and learning activities, promotional messaging and sponsored projects.  Available services include application support for Canvas & Blackboard courses.  Our Modalis website tool facilitates management and delivery of assets outside ASU's Learning Management System.Update  - MediaAMP has informed ASU that the product is at end-of-life.  ASU is currently pursuing a replacement solution that will allow for the media to be migrated, the links to be updated, and the layered interactivity  to work in whatever new solution is identified.  MediaPlus is the replacement.  MediaPlus is already in production and can be manually embedded into any Canvas page  but a Canvas integration is being developed.","category":"Content","tag":["Video Platform"],"contact":["jsipahig@asu.edu"],"videoSrc":"","owner":["Academic Enterprise"],"ctaLink":"https://onlinestudio.asu.edu/media-amp","ctaToolRequestFormLink":"https://airtable.com/apppjYD56k3fq9H2G/shrHOfYdam3oUARz3?prefill_fldTjPdpBxRPLvsVz=MediaAMP&prefill_fldgdYu8iKfA5ts7N=recaMgfYeDIQCJuO4&hide_fldgdYu8iKfA5ts7N=true"}
