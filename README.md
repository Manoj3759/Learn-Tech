#### Local dev server

- `yarn dev`: to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Workflow

- Normal workflow, branch out of `Master` to add new feature to the project. The naming convention of feature branch is `feature/[feature-name]`.
- Once your work is done, issue a PR on `Master` branch, and once its approved, it will be passed onto the `staging` env.
- Once its merged onto the `test` branch, then you will be able to test the functionality on [staging environment]().
